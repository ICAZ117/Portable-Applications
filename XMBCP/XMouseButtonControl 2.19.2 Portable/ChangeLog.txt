	 stays down even though the description in the simulated keystrokes editor says that this is not the case.

	 when using {LMB}, {RMB}, {MMB}

Version 1.46.5: (Internal build)
	Added option to make the mouse scroll wheel scroll the window under the mouse cursor.
	Changed the installation to use the Nullsoft Installer System. 
	 This is much faster and means I can have a single (small) distribution for both
	 x86 and x64 versions.

	 only apply to the following key anyway.

	 to use the settings from Scroll WheelDown instead of its own setting.

	 sent correctly because the same "key down" is sent twice without a "key up" in between.

	 did not work when a non-English keyboard was installed.

Version 1.41:
	Added ability to copy application specific settings to a new application.
	Modified the logging to always create a log file with some useful information in it.

	 actions like "double click" defined.

	 executable, ideal for running from a USB stick.

	 It is also enabled if the /portable command line switch is specified.

Version 1.40:
	Fixed some bugs that could cause crashes under certain circumstances.
