2. Changes since version 2.4.2: 


Improvements

 * Audacity now uses 'aup3' format, with all audio in one file, rather than 
   the previous 'pile of file' format.  We are using the SQLite library to 
   manageis the contents of this file.  Too many users were previously getting
   caught out by copying part of the project only, when backing up.
 * 'Backup Project' command replaces 'Save Lossless Copy of Project' and 'Save 
   Compressed Copy of Project'
 * Added Corsican and Marathi languages.
 * 'Label Sounds' replaces 'Sound Finder' and 'Silence Finder'.
 * Added Import and Export of Macros.
 * Added Attack, Hold and Delay times to Noise Gate.
 * Added Multi-View option to Track Preferences
 * Added hidden (bindable to shortcuts) commands for repeating last generator, 
   analyzer or tool.  Previously only most recent effect could be repeated.
 * Upgraded Nyquist to 3.16
